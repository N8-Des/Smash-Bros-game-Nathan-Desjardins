# Welcome to Copyfight! 

## What is Copyfight?
This game was created by me as a joke, but I ended up working on it for over a year. The code is choppy as a result, and it is far from my best work. Since this game was a solo project, I had to animate almost everything myself. And while I am not an animator, nor do I plan to be, I ended up animating around **1,700 animations** on my own. Due to the time constraints, I feel the code fell short, and if I have time, I have plans to make it better in the future. 


## Installation
The first and hardest step is installing Unity. For some reason Unity has made it more and more difficult for people to start over
the years. For this reason, plus the fact that my game was made with an old version of Unity, we will be using Unity 5.6.3. Once Unity is
installed, the installation process is incredibly easy... hopefully. 
Also just download my Repository first, as you'll need it later. 

1. Go to Unity's [download archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). Here you want to select the Unity 5.x tab.

2. Under Unity 5.x, scroll down to 5.6.3, and choose the dropdown that fits your computer (Mac or Windows) and select **Unity Installer**.

3. Once that is downloaded, launch it and folllow the installation wizard process. 

4. Once you come across a screen with a bunch of checkmarks, just hit next. Unless you really know what you're doing, the default settings
work just fine. 

5. Unity and the Unity Editor will install. Once that is done, click on Unity. One of two things will happen.
      - a. Unity will launch and you will see a window appear that says welcome. 
      - b. It will ask you to download Unity Hub (DO NOT DO THIS)  

6. If your Unity did A, just go to wherever Unity says projects are being stored (should be documents on Windows by default). Unzip this 
repository, plop the folder in the stored projects folder, and restart Unity. My game should show up, now just click it!
      However, if your Unity did B, decline downloading Unity Hub (You need a key or something for that and it's super annoying). Instead, 
unzip my repository, and put the single folder inside somewhere you'll remember. When you launch your unity, an option should come up on 
the popup saying "select existing project" or something of that manner. Click on that, and select the folder you just unzipped. And voila,
my game should open!
